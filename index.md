### Programmer Journey

Hi, I am **Meshach Adoe**. I am currently a student enrolled in CSE110, learning *Software Engineering* with Prof. Powell. Prior to this course, I have had experience with `javascript` and `html/css`. I mostly focus on front-end development, and have dabbled in backend web development as well. A website I have been working on in the past summer is [Kerja.io](https://www.kerja.io).

### About Me

In my spare time, I enjoy watching science fiction movies and TV shows, with one of my favorite quotes being:

> "I AM the senate!"
> Supreme Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious
