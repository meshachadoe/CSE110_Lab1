# About Me
## Programmer Journey

Hi, I am **Meshach Adoe**. I am currently a student enrolled in CSE110, learning *Software Engineering* with Prof. Powell. Prior to this course, I have had experience with `javascript` and `html/css`. I mostly focus on front-end development, and have dabbled in backend web development as well. A website I have been working on in the past summer is [Kerja.io](https://www.kerja.io).

The languages that I have had experience with are
- JavaScript
- Python
- C/C++
- Java
- Swift

Here's a code snippet of an asynchronous call in JS cause why not?
```
let fetch =  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   // do something async 
   resolve();
}).then(()=> {   
   console.log('Yay!');
})
```
